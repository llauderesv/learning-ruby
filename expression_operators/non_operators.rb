# Non Operators
# Operators are written using punctuation characters.

# Paranthesis ()
# Parentheses are an optional part of method definition and invocation syntax. 
# It is better to think of method invocation as a special kind of expression 
# than to think of () as a method-invocation operator. 
# Parentheses are also used for grouping to affect the order of evaluation of subexpressions.


# Square Braket []
# Square brackers are used in array literals and for querying and setting array and hash values.


# Curly Braces {}
# Are an alternative to do/end in blocks, and are also used in hash literals. 
# In neither case do they act as operators.


# . and ::
# are used in qualified named, separating the names of a method from the object on which it is invoked
# or the name of a constant from the module in which it is defined.


# : 
# A colon is used to prefix symbol literals and is also used in Ruby 1.9 hash syntax.
